# Stoichiometry-Calculator

A Calculator which only solves Grade 11 Chemistry questions

### Api Version

This version(v3) is meant to be used with jupyter notebook. You can do some additional script to it, and it is a better pythonic object orientated program in terms of code styles. See sample code in example.py.

### Normal Version

You execute it in a terminal and it has simple user interface. However, it's only v2, so that the code is not clean and relatively old. If you want to see the program in details, the api version might be a better choice. Also, some feauture related to automatic unit convertion is not great because I wrote that while waiting for the Disney firework show. I have no idea of what I wrote that night.

### Web APP

You can run the flask development server in the directory of this project to run the web app. Navigate to the project directory.

First, install flask
```shell
pip install Flask
```
Now run the Flask development server
```shell
flask run
```

## NOTE
The molecular calculation (available in normal version) seems to be broken, I will try to fix or rewrite that part when I'm free.
