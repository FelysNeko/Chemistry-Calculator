# Stoichiometry-Calculator

A Calculator which only solves Canadian grade 11 chemistry questions

[UPDATE]
  - The reconstruction is already finally done! The program now works 2 to 20 times faster that the old version.
  - A new command line interface is added, so that you can run it in terminal :)
  - If I have time I will add new features related to stoichiometry such as yield, purity etc.
